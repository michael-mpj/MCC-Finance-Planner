### Specific Tasks

#### Project Setup
- [ ] Run `chmod +x setup.sh && ./setup.sh`
- [ ] Verify dependencies installed (`electron`, `react`, `vite`, `zustand`, `bootstrap`, `firebase`, `xlsx`, etc.)
- [ ] Confirm ESLint + Prettier configs are working (`npm run lint` / `npm run format`)

  - [ ] Login
  - [ ] Dashboard
  - [ ] Transactions
  - [ ] Reports
  - [ ] Import/Export
  - [ ] Settings

#### Authentication
- [ ] Enable **Firebase Auth** (Google + Email/Password)
- [ ] Store logged-in user's UID in Zustand store
- [ ] Protect routes (redirect to login if not authenticated)

#### Transactions

- [ ] Local/Cloud backup options

#### Backup & Cloud
- [ ] Firestore security rules (user-only access)
- [ ] Google Drive API integration (backup JSON to Drive)
- [ ] Restore from Google Drive

#### Testing & Quality
- [ ] Unit tests with **Vitest**
- [ ] End-to-end tests with **Playwright** (Electron app flows)
- [ ] Run **ESLint** and **Prettier** consistently

#### Build & Release
- [ ] Test dev mode: `npm run dev`
- [ ] Package app: `npm run electron:build`
- [ ] Verify installers on Windows / macOS / Linux
- [ ] Upload build files to **landing page** (`downloads/` folder)

### Acceptance Criteria
